# Hi, I'm Satria Nur Saputro! üëã

A distinguished graduate of Telkom Institute of Technology Purwokerto, where I earned a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in
Informatics Engineering** with cum laude honors (GPA: 3.94). My academic journey includes significant contributions to
scientific research, notably co-authoring two peer-reviewed journals: **"Classification of 90 Animal Genera Taxonomies
Using Transfer Learning with ResNet-152"** (Sinta 1, 92% accuracy) and **"Clickbait News Headline Classification Using
RNN-LSTM"** (Sinta 3, 79% accuracy). I further honed my skills through the **"Kampus Merdeka" MSIB bootcamp** and the *
*"AI Mastery" course** at Orbit Future Academy, achieving an A grade in both programs. My capstone project, **"Employee
Feedback Analysis Using Face Recognition and a BERT-based Website"**, showcased my ability to integrate advanced AI
technologies into practical solutions.

Professionally, I am an accomplished **Backend Engineer** with over a year of experience designing, optimizing, and
scaling complex systems. My roles at **PT. Satkomindo Mediyasa** (a BRI subsidiary) and **PT. Sinar Mitra Sepadan** (
Orix Group) involved developing backend features for the **NDS BRI application** and **SMS financial system** using *
*GoLang**, **REST/gRPC APIs**, and **microservices**. I have expertise in programming languages like **GoLang**, *
*JavaScript**, and **Python**, and proficiency in database management with **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, *
*RabbitMQ**, and **MongoDB**. My technical skills extend to storage systems (**Google Cloud Storage**, **MinIO**, **FTP
**), delivery platforms (**Docker**, **Liquibase**, **Red Hat OpenShift**, **Atlassian Bamboo**, **Jenkins**), and
monitoring tools (**Jaeger**, **Kibana**, **SonarQube**). I am also adept in **Linux**, **Git**, **Bitbucket**, **Jira
**, **Confluence**, and **Notion**.

As a committed Backend Engineer, I am driven by a passion for technology and a dedication to continuous improvement. I
excel in delivering innovative solutions, solving complex problems, and collaborating effectively within dynamic teams.
My strengths include meticulous organization, exceptional time management, and a proven ability to adapt and learn
quickly, underpinned by a strong sense of professionalism and motivation. I am eager to leverage my expertise to
contribute to cutting-edge projects and advance organizational goals.

**üòÑ Motto**: *0.0001 seconds can change everything.*
